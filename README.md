# Solving Algorithm Problems
This repo is a place I am going to put my work-in-progress solutions to some algorithm problems. The main source of material for these prompts is "Algorithmic Thinking" by Daniel Zingaro (No Starch Press), website [here](https://www.danielzingaro.com/alg//menu/about.html).

As the book examples are written in C, and I am currently learning C, this is the language I will try to use as a first pass on these problems. However, for more practice in algorithms and other languages, I plan on implementing the solutions in Python, Javascript, and possibly others, such as C# and C++.

So as to not just copy from the book, I have come up with my own solutions, yet I do draw inspiration from the author's code and helpful insights he provides throughout the chapters. Also, for now, the programs I write here are meant to focus on the algorithmic aspect of the problems, so worrying about input and output formatting has been left up to future me.

## Current Solutions
Below are the problems that currently have solutions here, along with page numbers from the book as reference.
